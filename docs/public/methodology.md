# Our Methodology

## How We Track Politicians' Positions on Project 2025

At "Fight Against the Quiet Coup," we are committed to providing transparent, accurate information about politicians' positions on Project 2025. This document explains our research methodology, scoring system, and quality control processes.

## Our Approach

### Core Principles

Our methodology is guided by these fundamental principles:

1. **Evidence-Based**: All assessments are based on documented statements and actions
2. **Transparent**: We clearly explain how we arrive at our conclusions
3. **Nonpartisan**: We apply the same standards to all politicians regardless of party
4. **Comprehensive**: We examine positions across the full range of Project 2025 policies
5. **Current**: We regularly update our assessments as new information emerges

### What We Track

We monitor and document:

- **Public Statements**: Speeches, interviews, press releases, and social media posts
- **Voting Records**: Votes on legislation related to Project 2025 policies
- **Sponsored Legislation**: Bills introduced or co-sponsored
- **Campaign Materials**: Official position statements and platforms
- **Public Actions**: Executive orders, administrative actions, and policy implementations

## Our Scoring System

### The Scale

We use a 5-point scale to represent positions on Project 2025:

| Score | Position | What It Means |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| +2 | Explicit Support | The politician has clearly endorsed Project 2025 or its specific policy recommendations |
| +1 | Implicit Support | The politician has expressed views that align with Project 2025 positions without directly referencing it |
| 0 | Neutral/Unclear | The politician has not taken a clear position or has made contradictory statements |
| -1 | Implicit Opposition | The politician has expressed views that contradict Project 2025 positions without directly opposing it |
| -2 | Explicit Opposition | The politician has clearly opposed Project 2025 or its specific policy recommendations |

### Policy Categories

We evaluate positions across these key Project 2025 policy areas:

1. **Executive Power**: Positions on expanding presidential authority
2. **Federal Workforce**: Views on civil service reforms
3. **Regulatory Approach**: Positions on regulatory agencies and enforcement
4. **Immigration**: Alignment with Project 2025 immigration policies
5. **Education**: Positions on Department of Education and educational policies
6. **Healthcare**: Views on healthcare systems and policies
7. **Energy & Environment**: Positions on environmental regulations and energy policy
8. **Foreign Policy**: Alignment with Project 2025 foreign policy approaches
9. **Social Issues**: Positions on Project 2025 approaches to social policies
10. **Economic Policy**: Views on taxation, spending, and economic regulation

### How We Calculate Scores

#### Category Scores

For each policy category, we:

1. Collect all relevant statements and actions
2. Evaluate each piece of evidence on our 5-point scale
3. Give more weight to:
   - More recent statements/actions
   - Direct statements about Project 2025
   - Official actions (votes, sponsored legislation)
4. Calculate a weighted average for the category
5. Round to the nearest 0.5 point

#### Overall Score

The overall score is:

1. A weighted average of all category scores
2. Categories with more evidence receive proportionally higher weight
3. Rounded to the nearest 0.5 point

### Confidence Levels

Each score includes a confidence level:

- **High**: Strong evidence base with multiple primary sources
- **Medium**: Adequate evidence with some primary sources
- **Low**: Limited evidence available

We clearly indicate when we have insufficient evidence to make a determination.

## Our Research Process

### Evidence Collection

1. **Systematic Monitoring**: We continuously monitor news sources, congressional records, campaign materials, and social media
2. **Comprehensive Research**: We conduct thorough background research on each politician
3. **Primary Sources**: We prioritize direct quotes, official records, and first-hand accounts
4. **Documentation**: We maintain a detailed database of all evidence with full source information

### Verification Process

All information undergoes this verification process:

1. **Source Verification**: We confirm the authenticity and reliability of each source
2. **Context Check**: We examine the full context of statements to ensure fair representation
3. **Fact-Checking**: We verify factual claims against multiple sources
4. **Peer Review**: Multiple researchers review each assessment
5. **Editorial Review**: Senior editors provide final approval

### Regular Updates

We update our assessments:

1. **When New Information Emerges**: We promptly incorporate new statements or actions
2. **Quarterly Reviews**: We conduct regular reviews of all profiles
3. **Election Cycle Updates**: We increase frequency of updates during campaign seasons
4. **Policy Evolution**: We adjust as Project 2025 policies or interpretations evolve

## Quality Control

### Multi-Level Review

Every assessment undergoes:

1. **Researcher Review**: Initial assessment by a trained researcher
2. **Peer Review**: Secondary review by another researcher
3. **Editorial Review**: Final review by a senior editor
4. **Periodic Audits**: Random audits by external experts

### Correction Policy

If we make an error:

1. We promptly correct the information
2. We transparently note the correction
3. We review our processes to prevent similar errors

### Public Feedback

We welcome input from the public:

1. Users can submit additional evidence through our feedback form
2. We review all submissions for accuracy and relevance
3. We incorporate verified information into our assessments

## Limitations and Transparency

We are transparent about the limitations of our methodology:

1. **Incomplete Information**: Politicians may not have public positions on all issues
2. **Interpretation Challenges**: Statements may be ambiguous or context-dependent
3. **Evolving Landscape**: Project 2025 itself may evolve over time
4. **Resource Constraints**: Depth of research may vary based on available resources

## Conclusion

Our methodology is designed to provide users with an accurate, nuanced understanding of politicians' positions on Project 2025. We are committed to continuous improvement and welcome feedback on how we can better serve this mission.
