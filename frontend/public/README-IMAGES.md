# Image Placeholders for Fight Against the Quiet Coup

This file explains the purpose of the image placeholders referenced in the application.

## Required Images for PWA and Social Sharing

The following image files should be created and placed in this directory:

1. `og-image.png` - Open Graph image for social media sharing (recommended size: 1200x630 pixels)
2. `shortcut-politicians.png` - Icon for the Politicians shortcut (size: 192x192 pixels)
3. `shortcut-dashboard.png` - Icon for the Dashboard shortcut (size: 192x192 pixels)
4. `screenshot1.png` - Desktop screenshot for PWA store listings (size: 1280x720 pixels)
5. `screenshot2.png` - Mobile screenshot for PWA store listings (size: 750x1334 pixels)

These images should follow the application's blue/gold color scheme and maintain the investigative theme.

## Image Guidelines

- Use the gold accent color (#ff9800) and dark background (#1e1e1e) for consistency
- Include the application logo in the Open Graph image
- Screenshots should showcase key features of the application
- Icons should be simple and recognizable

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images, but they should be replaced with proper designs before production deployment.
