  - [x] ResistanceLevelPage for viewing politicians by resistance level

### Backend Development
- [x] Express server setup with MVC architecture
- [x] Database models defined for core entities (politicians, statements, scores, etc.)
- [x] API routes established for core functionality
- [x] Authentication middleware implemented
- [x] Controllers implemented for main resources

### Frontend Development
- [x] React application scaffolded with Create React App
- [x] Component structure organized by feature
- [x] Basic routing implemented with React Router
- [x] Authentication context created

- [x] Core pages created (Home, Politicians, Statements, etc.)

### Data Processing
- [x] Scripts created for processing and importing data
- [x] Gemini data processing pipeline implemented

### Data Pipeline Implementation (June 19, 2025)
- [x] Database schema updated with `is_active` column for soft deletes
- [x] PostgreSQL database running in Docker container
- [x] Initial schema created with all required tables
- [x] Tavily MCP server already configured and ready to use
- [x] Data reconciliation script exists and ready to use
- [x] Import script updated to handle soft deletes and vetted data
- [x] Congress.gov API data fetched (2,597 members)
- [x] Data reconciliation completed
- [x] Final data import completed (538 active members)
- [ ] Politician scoring pending (requires research data)

### Backend Fixes (June 19, 2025)
- [x] Fixed all model foreign key data types (UUID to STRING(20))
- [x] Fixed middleware import issues in enhancedScoring routes
- [x] Installed missing nodemailer dependency
- [x] Backend server running successfully on port 5000

## In Progress
