# Active Context

## Current Session Focus (June 19, 2025)
Successfully fixed backend ES module/CommonJS conflicts and got the backend server running.

## Completed Tasks
1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `is_active` column to politicians table for soft-delete functionality
   - Changed politician ID from UUID to VARCHAR(20) to accommodate bioguide IDs
   - Updated all related foreign key constraints

2. **Data Pipeline Implementation**
   - Fetched 2,597 members from Congress.gov API
   - Created vetted data file through reconciliation process
   - Successfully imported 538 active Congress members (415 new, 123 updated)
   - Implemented soft-delete mechanism to mark inactive politicians

3. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - PostgreSQL database running in Docker
   - Tavily MCP server configured and ready
   - All necessary dependencies installed

4. **Backend Fixes**
   - Fixed all model foreign key data types to match new politician ID type (STRING(20))
   - Fixed middleware import issues in enhancedScoring routes
   - Installed missing nodemailer dependency
   - Backend server now running successfully on port 5000

## Current State
- Database contains 538 active politicians with complete data
- Backend is running and connected to database
- API available at http://localhost:5000/api/v1
- Frontend ready but not tested
- Scoring functionality requires research data to be generated first

## Next Steps
1. Generate research data for politician scoring
2. Test the full application stack
3. Implement web scraping with Firecrawl for data verification
4. Add Tavily search for real-time politician information updates

## Technical Decisions
- Using bioguide IDs as primary keys instead of UUIDs
- Soft-delete approach for maintaining historical data
- Direct SQL queries for data import (bypassing Sequelize for performance)

## Known Issues
- Scoring script requires research_results.json which doesn't exist yet
- Many historical Congress members skipped due to missing current term data
