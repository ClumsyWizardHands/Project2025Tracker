5. **Recency**: Timeliness of the information
6. **Context**: Completeness of the information

## Verification Process

### Multi-Step Verification

Every piece of information undergoes this verification process:

1. **Initial Collection**
   - Researcher identifies relevant statement or action
   - Full context is documented (date, location, circumstances)
   - Complete source information is recorded

2. **Primary Source Verification**
   - Original source is located and reviewed
   - Full context is examined
   - Any editing or paraphrasing is checked against original
   - Multiple sources are cross-referenced when possible

3. **Context Analysis**
   - Circumstances of the statement/action are documented
   - Related statements or clarifications are identified
   - Historical positions on the issue are noted
   - Potential motivations or influences are considered

4. **Relevance Assessment**
   - Connection to specific Project 2025 policies is established
   - Strength and clarity of the position is evaluated
   - Consistency with other statements is analyzed
   - Significance within overall position is determined

5. **Peer Review**
   - Second researcher independently verifies information
   - Methodology and interpretation are reviewed
   - Additional context or sources may be suggested
   - Disagreements are documented and resolved

6. **Editorial Review**
   - Senior editor conducts final review
   - Consistency with platform standards is ensured
   - Potential biases are identified and addressed
   - Final approval before publication

### Handling Ambiguity

When statements or positions are unclear:

1. We clearly indicate the level of certainty in our assessment
2. We present multiple possible interpretations when appropriate
3. We note when insufficient evidence exists for a determination
4. We update assessments when clarifying information emerges

## Quality Control Measures

### Ongoing Monitoring

We maintain accuracy through continuous monitoring:

1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Quarterly audit of all politician profiles
   - Systematic check for new statements or actions
   - Review of methodology and scoring consistency
   - Update of evidence database and assessments

2. **Event-Triggered Reviews**
   - Major policy speeches or announcements
   - Significant votes or legislative actions
   - Campaign launches or platform releases
   - Public position changes or clarifications

3. **External Feedback**
   - User-submitted evidence and corrections
   - Expert review and consultation
   - Media fact-checking and analysis
   - Politician or campaign responses

### Correction Policy

When errors are identified:

1. **Prompt Correction**
   - Errors are corrected as soon as they are verified
   - Corrections are clearly noted on the affected content
   - The correction date and nature are documented
   - Original error is preserved in correction log for transparency

2. **Severity Classification**
   - Minor: Typos, formatting issues, non-substantive errors
   - Moderate: Factual errors that don't affect overall assessment
   - Major: Errors that significantly impact assessment or understanding

3. **Notification Process**
   - Major corrections trigger notification to users who have interacted with the content
   - All corrections are listed in a public corrections log
   - Systematic errors prompt methodology review and updates

4. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Process failures are identified and addressed
   - Training materials are updated if needed
   - Verification procedures may be enhanced

## Special Considerations

### Handling Contradictions

When politicians make contradictory statements:

1. We document all relevant statements with full context
2. We note the chronology to identify potential position evolution
3. We give more weight to more recent, more specific, and more formal statements
4. We clearly indicate contradictions in our assessment

### Implicit vs. Explicit Positions

We distinguish between:

1. **Explicit positions**: Direct statements about Project 2025
2. **Implicit positions**: Statements about policies contained in Project 2025 without direct reference
3. **Inferred positions**: Positions that may be reasonably inferred from other statements or actions

Each type is clearly labeled in our assessments, with explicit positions given greater weight.

### Evolving Interpretations

As understanding of Project 2025 evolves:

1. We update our policy category definitions
2. We reassess statements based on new context
3. We document changes in interpretation
4. We maintain transparency about evolving standards

## Public Accountability

### Transparency Measures

We maintain public trust through:

1. **Open Methodology**
   - Detailed documentation of all processes
   - Regular methodology reviews and updates
   - Public explanation of any methodology changes

2. **Source Transparency**
   - Links to original sources whenever possible
   - Full citation information for all sources
   - Archive links for digital content that may change

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**
   - Public submission form for evidence and corrections
   - Clear process for reviewing submissions
   - Timely response to all substantive feedback

4. **Independent Review**
   - Regular audits by external experts
