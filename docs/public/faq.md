# Frequently Asked Questions

## About "Fight Against the Quiet Coup"

### What is "Fight Against the Quiet Coup"?

"Fight Against the Quiet Coup" is a non-partisan platform dedicated to tracking and analyzing politicians' positions on Project 2025. We provide evidence-based assessments of where elected officials and candidates stand on the policies outlined in this influential policy blueprint.

### What is Project 2025?

Project 2025 is a comprehensive policy blueprint published by The Heritage Foundation and its partners. It outlines a detailed agenda for a potential conservative administration, covering virtually every aspect of the federal government. The 900+ page document includes specific policy recommendations across all executive branch departments and agencies.

### Why does this matter?

Project 2025 represents one of the most comprehensive efforts to reshape the federal government in recent history. Its recommendations would significantly impact federal policies on healthcare, education, immigration, environmental protection, and many other areas that affect Americans' daily lives. Understanding where politicians stand on these proposals helps voters make informed decisions.

### Are you affiliated with any political party or organization?

No. "Fight Against the Quiet Coup" is an independent, non-partisan initiative. We are not affiliated with any political party, campaign, or advocacy organization. Our sole mission is to provide accurate, transparent information about politicians' positions on Project 2025.

### Who funds this platform?

Our platform is funded through a combination of foundation grants and individual donations from supporters who value political transparency. We maintain strict editorial independence from all funding sources. A complete list of major donors is available on our [About page](https://www.fightquietcoup.org/about).

## Our Methodology

### How do you determine politicians' positions?

We use a rigorous, evidence-based methodology to assess politicians' positions on Project 2025. This includes analyzing:

- Public statements and interviews
- Voting records on related legislation
- Sponsored or co-sponsored bills
- Campaign materials and position papers
- Executive actions (for those in executive positions)

Each piece of evidence is evaluated, weighted, and categorized to create a comprehensive assessment. For more details, see our [Methodology page](methodology.md).

### What does your scoring system mean?

We use a 5-point scale to represent positions on Project 2025:

- **+2**: Explicit Support - Has clearly endorsed Project 2025 or its specific policies
- **+1**: Implicit Support - Has expressed views aligned with Project 2025 without direct reference
- **0**: Neutral/Unclear - Has not taken a clear position or has made contradictory statements
- **-1**: Implicit Opposition - Has expressed views contrary to Project 2025 without direct opposition
- **-2**: Explicit Opposition - Has clearly opposed Project 2025 or its specific policies

### How often do you update your assessments?

We update politician profiles:
- Whenever new relevant statements or actions occur
- During quarterly reviews of all profiles
- More frequently during election seasons
- When Project 2025 policies or interpretations evolve

### How do you ensure accuracy?

We maintain accuracy through:
1. Rigorous source verification and fact-checking
2. Multi-level review process (researcher, peer, and editorial reviews)
3. Transparent citation of all sources
4. Clear correction policy for any errors
5. Regular audits by external experts
6. Public feedback mechanism

### What if a politician hasn't made statements about Project 2025?

Many politicians haven't explicitly addressed Project 2025 by name. In these cases, we analyze their positions on specific policies contained within Project 2025. We clearly indicate when we're assessing implicit rather than explicit positions, and we note when we have insufficient evidence to make a determination.
