# Scoring Methodology Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the methodology used by "Fight Against the Quiet Coup" to score politicians based on their positions related to Project 2025. Our scoring system is designed to be transparent, consistent, and evidence-based, providing users with a clear understanding of how politicians align with or oppose Project 2025 policies.

## Core Principles

Our scoring methodology is guided by these core principles:

1. **Evidence-Based**: All scores must be supported by documented statements or actions
2. **Transparent**: The basis for each score is clearly explained and accessible
3. **Consistent**: The same criteria are applied to all politicians regardless of party
4. **Nuanced**: Recognizes degrees of support or opposition rather than binary positions
5. **Current**: Regularly updated to reflect evolving positions
6. **Comprehensive**: Considers the full range of Project 2025 policy areas

## Scoring Scale

We use a 5-point scale to represent positions on Project 2025:

| Score | Position | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| +2 | Explicit Support | Has explicitly endorsed Project 2025 or its specific policy recommendations |
| +1 | Implicit Support | Has expressed views aligned with Project 2025 positions without direct endorsement |
| 0 | Neutral/Unclear | Has not taken a clear position or has made contradictory statements |
| -1 | Implicit Opposition | Has expressed views contrary to Project 2025 positions without direct opposition |
| -2 | Explicit Opposition | Has explicitly opposed Project 2025 or its specific policy recommendations |

## Policy Categories

Politicians are scored across these key Project 2025 policy areas:

1. **Executive Power**: Positions on expanding presidential authority
2. **Federal Workforce**: Views on "Schedule F" and civil service reforms
3. **Regulatory Approach**: Positions on regulatory agencies and enforcement
4. **Immigration**: Alignment with Project 2025 immigration policies
5. **Education**: Positions on Department of Education and educational policies
6. **Healthcare**: Views on healthcare systems and policies
7. **Energy & Environment**: Positions on environmental regulations and energy policy
8. **Foreign Policy**: Alignment with Project 2025 foreign policy approaches
9. **Social Issues**: Positions on Project 2025 approaches to social policies
10. **Economic Policy**: Views on taxation, spending, and economic regulation

## Evidence Types and Weighting

Different types of evidence carry different weights in our scoring system:

### Primary Evidence (Highest Weight)

- Direct quotes about Project 2025 specifically
- Votes on legislation directly related to Project 2025 policies
- Official position papers or campaign platforms
- Sponsorship of relevant legislation

### Secondary Evidence (Medium Weight)

- Statements on policies aligned with Project 2025 (without direct reference)
- Voting patterns on related legislation
- Public appearances with Project 2025 authors or proponents
- Op-eds or articles authored by the politician

### Contextual Evidence (Lower Weight)

- Party platform positions
- Historical positions on similar issues
- Statements by staff or campaign representatives
- Associations with organizations aligned with or opposed to Project 2025

## Scoring Methodology

### Individual Statement/Action Scoring

Each piece of evidence is evaluated using this process:

1. **Categorization**: Assign to relevant policy category
2. **Position Assessment**: Determine where it falls on the -2 to +2 scale
3. **Evidence Type**: Classify as primary, secondary, or contextual
4. **Recency**: Note when the statement/action occurred
5. **Context**: Document the full context of the statement/action
6. **Source Verification**: Verify and document the source

### Category Score Calculation

For each policy category:

1. Calculate the weighted average of all evidence in that category
2. Give more recent statements/actions greater weight
3. Primary evidence is weighted at 1.0
4. Secondary evidence is weighted at 0.7
5. Contextual evidence is weighted at 0.3
6. Round to the nearest 0.5 point on the scale

### Overall Score Calculation

The overall score is calculated as:

1. Calculate the weighted average across all policy categories
2. Categories with more evidence receive proportionally higher weight
3. Round to the nearest 0.5 point on the scale

## Score Presentation

Scores are presented with these elements:

1. **Overall Score**: Numerical value and visual representation
2. **Category Breakdown**: Individual scores for each policy area
3. **Evidence Summary**: Key statements/actions supporting the score
4. **Confidence Level**: Indication of how much evidence supports the score
5. **Last Updated**: Date when the score was last reviewed

## Confidence Levels

Each score includes a confidence level:

| Level | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| High | Strong evidence base | Multiple pieces of primary evidence across time periods |
| Medium | Adequate evidence | Some primary evidence, supplemented by secondary sources |
| Low | Limited evidence | Primarily contextual or limited evidence available |

## Score Review Process

Scores undergo this review process:

1. **Initial Scoring**: Researcher compiles evidence and proposes scores
2. **Peer Review**: Second researcher reviews evidence and scoring
3. **Editorial Review**: Senior editor approves or requests revisions
4. **Publication**: Score is published with all supporting evidence
5. **Regular Review**: Scores are reviewed on a quarterly basis
6. **Event-Triggered Review**: New statements or actions trigger immediate review

## Handling Special Cases

### Evolving Positions

When a politician's position evolves over time:

1. Recent statements/actions receive greater weight
2. Historical positions are documented but weighted less heavily
3. Significant changes in position are highlighted in the evidence summary
4. The full history of position changes is maintained for transparency

### Contradictory Statements

When a politician makes contradictory statements:

1. Document all contradictory positions
2. Weight by recency and evidence type
3. If truly contradictory with no resolution, this may result in a neutral score
4. Note the contradiction explicitly in the evidence summary

### Limited Information

When limited information is available:

1. Score only categories with sufficient evidence
2. Indicate lower confidence level
3. Clearly state limitations in the evidence summary
4. Avoid speculation or assumptions to fill gaps

## Quality Assurance

To ensure scoring accuracy and consistency:

1. **Blind Rescoring**: Periodic blind rescoring by different researchers
2. **Consistency Checks**: Regular audits across politicians for consistent application
3. **External Review**: Quarterly review by external experts
4. **Public Feedback**: Mechanism for public to submit additional evidence
5. **Correction Policy**: Clear process for correcting errors when identified

## Limitations and Transparency

We acknowledge these limitations:

1. **Incomplete Information**: Politicians may not have public positions on all issues
2. **Interpretation Challenges**: Statements may be ambiguous or context-dependent
3. **Evolving Landscape**: Project 2025 itself may evolve over time
4. **Resource Constraints**: Depth of research may vary based on available resources

These limitations are transparently communicated alongside scores.

## Updates to Methodology

This methodology may be updated to improve accuracy and usefulness:

1. Major methodology changes will be announced publicly
2. Previous scores will be recalculated using new methodology when feasible
3. The methodology document will maintain a version history
4. User feedback will be incorporated into methodology improvements

## Conclusion

This scoring methodology is designed to provide users with an accurate, nuanced understanding of politicians' positions on Project 2025. By adhering to these guidelines, "Fight Against the Quiet Coup" aims to be a trusted, authoritative source of information on this important topic.
